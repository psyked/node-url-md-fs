# URL to Markdown
A command line Node.js library to input an URL and get a Markdown based version of the content.

# Usage

For ease of use, install globally:

npm install --global psyked/node-url-md-fs
```

To execute, get the URL of the page you'd like to download and supply that as the first command line parameter, eg:

```bash
node-url-md-fs https://medium.com/comparethemarket/colours-a-lightning-talk-%EF%B8%8F-80d209d58d3c

And providing there's no issues, you'll see an output like this:

```bash
